# Reversi-Othello-with-Minimax-and-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search

A .NET C# Reversi application.
I originally built the game for a project at school, but ever since submitting it I wanted to add a bot into the game, 
so you had someone to play against. 

I now added in two different bots, one that uses the MiniMax algorithm and another that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search.
You can also play against a bot that just outputs a random move, if you happen to be very unskilled at the game.

Check out the ReversiAI.cs file to see the AI code and how to implement either of the algorithms.
For the game itself you can check out Spel.cs.

I'm sorry if you cannot read Dutch, I had all the original code for school in Dutch, so I decided to add the rest in Dutch as well.
