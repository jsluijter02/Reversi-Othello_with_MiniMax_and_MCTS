# Reversi-Othello-with-Minimax-and-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search

A .NET C# Reversi application.
I originally built the game for a project at school, but ever since submitting it I wanted to add a bot into the game, 
so you had someone to play against. 

I now added in two different bots, one that uses the MiniMax algorithm and another that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search.
You can also play against a bot that just outputs a random move, if you happen to be very unskilled at the game.
